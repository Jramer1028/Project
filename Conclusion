Throughout the course, I found myself enjoying the learning that was taking place, and from what I learned, I now have a more defined idea of what I want my career to become. I see myself striving to be the person who helps make the networks that people use everyday.
The next step into going into a Networking IT career, is to go to my POLARIS class for Computer Networking. 
	One issue I had with the class was GitHub. I found it annoying and difficult to operate. I believe there are much simpiler sites to use that would have made this class a whole lot easier, such as google docs, or word.
