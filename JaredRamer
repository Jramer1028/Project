RESEARCH PROJECT
	Internet Architecture-
		My project will be explaining the complex design and architcture that makes up the internet. This topic always had my interest because before I could see no possible way for our wireless devices to connect to anything and not have it cross over with anything else. The idea perplexed me, and now that I know, I wish to make my final project about explaining it and diving into the research for it.
		
		Starting my project will be explaining how computers are each assigned a individuality called an "IP Address". Each device that is connected to the internet has a unique IP address. The two types are the IPv4 or IPv6.
		IPv4 is was the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, and was the first version to be deployed on the ARPERNET in 1983. It offered about 4.3 billion IP adresses to the world, so when the internet started blowing up, and more and more people began using it, we realized we needed more space, so thats when the IPv6 came out.
